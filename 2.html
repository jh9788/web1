    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
    document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1]
    CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
    [3] This separation can improve content accessibility,
    provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
     enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .
    css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .
    css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
